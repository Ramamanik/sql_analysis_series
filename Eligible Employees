IBM wants to reward employees who meet certain criteria. However, to ensure fairness, the following conditions must be met:


•	The employee must have been with the company for at least 3 years
•	The employee's department must have at least 5 employees
•	The salary must be within the top 10% of salaries within the department

--------

The output should include the Employee ID, Salary, and Department of the employees meeting the criteria.WITH tenure_filtered AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM employee_salaries
    WHERE tenure >= 3
),
department_counts AS (
    SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS dept_count
    FROM tenure_filtered
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
),
top_10_percent_salaries AS (
    SELECT department, 
           PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary) AS salary_threshold
    FROM tenure_filtered
    GROUP BY department
),
eligible_employees AS (
    SELECT tf.employee_id, tf.salary, tf.department
    FROM tenure_filtered tf
    INNER JOIN department_counts dc ON tf.department = dc.department
    INNER JOIN top_10_percent_salaries tps ON tf.department = tps.department
    WHERE tf.salary > tps.salary_threshold
)
SELECT employee_id, salary, department
FROM eligible_employees
ORDER BY employee_id;
