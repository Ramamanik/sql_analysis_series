Algorithm Performance
------------------------

Meta/Facebook is developing a search algorithm that will allow users to search through their post history. You have been assigned to evaluate the performance of this algorithm.


We have a table with the user's search term, search result positions, and whether or not the user clicked on the search result.


Write a query that assigns ratings to the searches in the following way:
•	If the search was not clicked for any term, assign the search with rating=1
•	If the search was clicked but the top position of clicked terms was outside the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=2
•	If the search was clicked and the top position of a clicked term was in the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=3


As a search ID can contain more than one search term, select the highest rating for that search ID. Output the search ID and its highest rating.


Example: The search_id 1 was clicked (clicked = 1) and its position is outside of the top 3 positions (search_results_position = 5), therefore its rating is 2.

Average Salaries
----------------
Compare each employee's salary with the average salary of the corresponding department.
Output the department, first name, and salary of employees along with the average salary of that department.

Best Selling Item
------------------
Find the best selling item for each month (no need to separate months by year) where the biggest total invoice was paid. The best selling item is calculated using the formula (unitprice * quantity). Output the month, the description of the item along with the amount paid.

Class Performance
-----------------
You are given a table containing assignment scores of students in a class. Write a query that identifies the largest difference in total score  of all assignments.
Output just the difference in total score (sum of all 3 assignments) between a student with the highest score and a student with the lowest score.

Comments Distribution
---------------------

Write a query to calculate the distribution of comments by the count of users that joined Meta/Facebook between 2018 and 2020, for the month of January 2020.


The output should contain a count of comments and the corresponding number of users that made that number of comments in Jan-2020. For example, you'll be counting how many users made 1 comment, 2 comments, 3 comments, 4 comments, etc in Jan-2020. Your left column in the output will be the number of comments while your right column in the output will be the number of users. Sort the output from the least number of comments to highest.



To add some complexity, there might be a bug where an user post is dated before the user join date. You'll want to remove these posts from the result.

Cookbook Recipes
----------------
You are given the table with titles of recipes from a cookbook and their page numbers. You are asked to represent how the recipes will be distributed in the book.
Produce a table consisting of three columns: left_page_number, left_title and right_title. The k-th row (counting from 0), should contain the number and the title of the page with the number 
2
×
𝑘
2×k in the first and second columns respectively, and the title of the page with the number 
2
×
𝑘
+
1
2×k+1 in the third column.
Each page contains at most 1 recipe. If the page does not contain a recipe, the appropriate cell should remain empty (NULL value). Page 0 (the internal side of the front cover) is guaranteed to be empty.
