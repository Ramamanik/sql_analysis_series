Identify projects that are overbudget. A project is overbudget if the prorated cost of all employees assigned to it exceeds the projectâ€™s budget.
To determine this, prorate each employee's annual salary to match the project's duration. For example, if a project with a six-month duration has a budget of $10,000.The total prorated annual employee salary should not exceed $10,000.Output a list of overbudget projects with the following details: project name, project budget, and prorated total employee expenses (rounded up to the nearest dollar).Assume all years have 365 days and disregard leap years.

Prorated Employee Expense Calculation:
--------------------------------------------
DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) calculates the project duration in days.
SUM(salary)/365 prorates the yearly salary for the project duration.
CEILING() ensures the result rounds up to the nearest whole number.
Joins:Combines linkedin_projects, linkedin_emp_projects, and linkedin_employees tables to link projects with their respective employees and salaries.
Group By:Groups data by project attributes: title, budget, start_date, and end_date.
Filtering:Uses HAVING to show only projects where prorated_employee_expense > budget.
Sorting:Outputs the projects alphabetically by their title.

solution
--------
SELECT title,
       budget,
       CEILING((DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) * SUM(salary)/365)) AS prorated_employee_expense
FROM linkedin_projects a
INNER JOIN linkedin_emp_projects b ON a.id = b.project_id
INNER JOIN linkedin_employees c ON b.emp_id=c.id
GROUP BY title, budget, end_date, start_date
HAVING prorated_employee_expense > budget
ORDER BY title ASC;
