The Power of SQL Indexes for Faster Queries
-------------------------------------------------
Indexes are not a one-size-fits-all solution. By analyzing query patterns and tailoring indexes to match,can achieve significant performance gains even in the most complex scenarios.Adding the right indexes to your database can make queries run 10x faster.optimizing indexes brought significant improvements.Indexes are like hidden superpowers in SQL, turning slow queries into lightning-fast insights! 

Key Achievements
--------------------
Before: A query on a 10-million-row table took 30 seconds to run.
After: By creating a composite index on frequently filtered and sorted columns, the runtime dropped to just 2 seconds.
Reduced I/O operations and improved the overall performance of the database.
Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexes: Understanding when to use each is crucial.
Avoid over-indexing:it can slow down write operations.
Regularly monitor and update indexes based on changing query patterns.

CREATE INDEX idx_region_date_category 
ON Sales (region, order_date, product_category);

SELECT 
    region, product_category, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    Sales
WHERE 
    region = 'West' 
    AND order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
    AND product_category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY 
    region, product_category;
